IDEAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

    *  Add bootstrap estimation of confidence intervals.
    *  Implement spline estimation of far.
    *  Using Sparse matrix calculation in far estimation not joined
       (with the SparseM library for instance).
    *  Use the new 'S4' system of classes and methods instead of the 
       actual 'S3'. (not sure it will be usefull)
