R package for modelization of Functional AutoRegressive processes

In collaboration with Serge Guillas, I write a paper called 
Estimation and simulation of autoregressive Hilbertian processes with exogenous 
variables which introduced application of ARH models, also known as FAR (Functional AutoRegressive processes). 

We write this library during this work and decided to freely 
distribute it as this work is now finished.

This library include modelizations and previsions functions for
Functional AutoRegressive processes using nonparametric methods: 
functional kernel,estimation of the covariance operator in
a subspace, ...
